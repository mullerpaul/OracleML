# Machine Learning in Oracle DB
In Oracle Enterprise Edition versions 12c and later, features in the "Advanced Analyitics" option will allow us to create (train) machine learning models against existing data, and then use the the models to make predictions about new data using SQL.
I will create a proof of concept (POC) to show this in action.

Here are some links about the advanced Analytics option:
